                        Sau Ying Lee lost everything, twice.<br><br>Lee was born in 1924 in China, in the years between the last Emperor and the rise of Mao Zedong.  She came from a well-to-do family, but when the communists took power, everything was taken from China’s rich families. Penniless, the Lee family escaped to Hong Kong, where Lee held three jobs to scrape together the money for plane tickets to the U.S., once it became clear that Hong Kong too, would be governed by the Communists.<br><br>The Lees moved here in 1972, when Saw Ying was 48. She never learned English, but worked as a babysitter and head of household for four children and eventually, five grandchildren, including her son Michael, now a teacher at LaFayette High School in Brooklyn.<br><br>At 91, her son, Michael Chung says, she was mentally alert and read the paper every day. “She believed the more we are informed, the better citizens we can become,” Chung said. <br><br>“Your birthday is coming up, I’m going to help you celebrate,” Lee told her grandson, Chung’s son in late September.  Saw Yang Lee didn’t live to see that birthday. In the early morning hours of October 14, she became the 200th New Yorker to die in a traffic crash in 2014, walking across Canal Street near Elizabeth, a few blocks from her home of 40 years.

                        Douglas Matrullo was a natty dresser. “He always used to walk around with the snakeskin boots,” his cousin Richard Matrullo said. “And fancy jackets, cowboy hats.”<br><br>Richard and Douglas grew up together in the West Village, playing games like skully, Johnny on a Pony, and kick the can. Douglas went to Our Lady of Pompeii, a Catholic grammar school on Carmine Street, and then Aviation High School. He didn’t stick around to graduate. Instead he dropped out and headed west to open a clothing boutique in San Francisco’s Haight Ashbury neighborhood.<br><br>After a while, he returned to New York, where he struggled with drugs and entered the city’s shelter system. Arlene Harrison, president of the Gramercy Park Block Association, met Douglas Matrullo at a neighborhood synagogue that serves the homeless. “He was quite a guy, quite a character in the best possible way,” she said. Matrullo later settled in to Kenmore Hall, a resident for the formerly homeless on 23rd Street.<br><br>Harrison said that even decades after his boutique days, Matrullo put a lot of care into his appearance. “I would see him in his black outfit, always with his black, in a black suitcase on wheels, meticulously dressed,” she recalled.<br><br>But she said it wasn’t his style that made him stand out -- it was how he helped people new to the shelter system by showing them the ropes. He was very private, she said, but welcoming and caring, too. “That’s how I see him – quite a special person.”

He diligently worked through a test prep program and reported in an online profile that, last year, he’d been accepted into business school. “You could tell he was constantly improving himself,” Humm said.<br><br>When Karol died, many London Terrace residents made the trip to Greenpoint, Brooklyn, for his wake. They also rallied to make donations to his wife, Margaret, who was pregnant with their first child.

The second was meeting his future wife, Jean Duffy, who came to the party with a friend. “That was 1982,” John said. “And we were together since that night.”<br><br>The couple married two years later and moved to an apartment on the Upper West Side. John said the stability of community kept them in the neighborhood for over 30 years.<br><br>Jean worked as a commercial artist and contributed to publications such as The New York Times and Good Housekeeping. But she also found time to volunteer as a Sunday school teacher and as a member of the choir at St. Michael’s Church on W 99th Street. Most mornings, Jean walked the family dogs, Pickle and Brody, in Riverside Park, and often stopped to chat with neighbors.<br><br>The Upper West Side was also where Jean and John Chambers raised their daughter, Maria, whom they adopted in 1996. Maria is now a freshman at Curry College in Massachusetts. “Jean was looking forward to seeing her success at college,” said John, “And we looked forward to spending more time together.”

                        Matt Brenner’s former girlfriend, Lily, says he was not the kind of person you’d expect to join the Air Force. “He was quirky and rebellious and had colorful tattoos,” she said. “He was definitely more Soho, New York.”<br><br>Matt grew up in Virginia, raised by a single mom. As an Air Force staff sergeant, he got to see places like England and South Korea, the way his grandfather did during his time in the service. After Matt’s honorable discharge, he moved to Washington D.C. and worked as a bike courier and underground music DJ. There, he met Lily. “He was loyal and thoughtful,” Lily said. “But not just with me – he was so in tune and connected to so many different types of people.”<br><br>The couple dated for 5 years, but then broke up. Matt moved to New York and began working in fashion. He was a production manager for Arsenal, a clothing company, and took night classes at the Fashion Institute of Technology.<br><br>“For the first time, Matt had a five and ten year plan,” Lily said. “I had never seen him so energized and happy.”

                        Joie Sellers danced.<br><br>From the instant you first set eyes on this tiny girl with the beautiful, sparkly brown eyes, you couldn't help but notice that she carried herself with grace as WELL as boundless positive energy. It stands to reason, as Joie was a dancer. She was a member of the select dance company at her middle school, M.S 51 in Park Slope, and among her favorite teachers was her dance teacher, Julie Gibson.<br><br>Joie danced her way through the 6th and 7th grade, with only kind and friendly words to say. Academically, she was an avid reader, and could often be found arguing over the subtext and character's intentions with her friends Leslie and Nubia, who were also in her book club. The very last book Joie was able to finish was Rainbow Rowell's Eleanor and Park, about which she had very definitive opinions.

Her friends, aware of her gift for organization, would enlist her to rearrange their kitchens, closets and bathrooms.<br><br>“I think she liked the challenge of chaos,” said her younger sister, Darlene. “Maybe that’s why she loved Manhattan.”<br><br>Jackie grew up on Staten Island, the third of four children. Though the family has dispersed, Jackie was the person who made sure everyone stayed in touch. “She was relentless,” Darlene recalled. “She had to make everything right, in her life and in her relationships.”<br><br>She was particularly close to her three nieces, to whom she regularly gave advice. “It was very heartwarming how important they were to her,” Darlene said. “She was a really good mother even though she wasn’t a mother.”<br><br>At the time she died, Jackie had almost completed her bachelor degree in Applied Sciences at NYU, with the hope of becoming a professional life coach and personal organizer.

                        Sometimes when Lyndasia Breville was watching television with her boyfriend he would disappear. But she always knew where to find him.<br><br>“I would catch him standing in the mirror in the bathroom checking himself out, flossing his teeth or inspecting his skin for new pimples,” she said, “He took good care of himself.”<br><br>The couple met through mutual friends when they were 17 but went to different schools, so it was three years before they were ‘official’. “I made it pretty hard for him,” recalled Lyndasia. “But he was a gorgeous guy. It was his charm that got me in the end.”<br><br>Leroy was also honest and vibrant, said Lyndasia, which also helped her fall for him. “He would always motivate me to get up, do things, go out to eat, not just lie in bed. He made sure everyone was okay.”<br><br>Leroy worked in construction but often talked about owning his own business and settling down with a family. Lyndasia is now pregnant with their first child.

                        As Zack grew up with a single mother in Orlando, Florida, he developed a special relationship with his Grandpa Tharp. Zack spent a lot of time as a boy at Tharp’s auto body shop, tinkering and repairing cars and talking about his plans to “make it big” in business and take care of his mom.<br><br>“They were close,” said Zack’s aunt, Jenny La Sala. “They were joined at the hip.” Tharp appreciated his grandson’s ambition, and told him, “Go build your own empire.”<br><br>In 1999, shortly before Zack’s twelfth birthday, he and his family suffered a blow: Grandpa Tharp was struck and killed by a van. “It had a tremendous impact on all of us, but on Zack especially,” his aunt recalled. “But those years, they had helped him grow into a wonderful young man. He was very positive. He never let anything stop him.”<br><br>When Zack moved to New York City at the age of 23, he set about building his empire – not in cars but music. He built his reputation as a producer, engineer and DJ, and was planning to move to L.A. “He was on the verge of making it,” La Sala said. “But he is with his beloved Grandpa now.”

                        Charity Hicks was at home in Detroit this spring when workers showed up to shut off the water at her neighbors’ houses. The city was targeting people all over the city who hadn’t paid their water bills.<br><br>Hicks came running out of her house, said Sanaa Green, a friend and colleague of Hicks. “She wanted to see if they would at least let the people draw some water in the tub.” While trying to warn a neighbor with young children, Hicks was arrested.<br><br>She lived her whole life with that headlong, fierce energy, Green said, but also with great love and joy. Her passion made her a sought-after public speaker on social justice issues, which is what brought her to New York. “She was always open and willing to share part of herself with people,” said Green.<br><br>At the community organization where she worked, Hicks stood out in her vibrant African print dresses. Young people flocked to her. Hicks would lecture them “about why they should all become activists,” Green said. “But they loved it.”<br><br> “I hope that me and the young people she talked to will be inspired to live a life of service,” Green said. “I think that’s a part of what we can make from her life.”

Her partner, Lyndon, was sentenced to 21 years in jail, leaving her to raise the children alone. “I learned to play football and basketball so I could play with them,” she said. “I became their mom and dad.”<br><br>And although she was only 17 when she had her first son, Dheyshawn, she says that his life made hers a little easier. “Even before he could talk he would crack me up,” she said. “People used to call him 'little Eddie Murphy.'”<br><br>Dheyshawn loved music and as a teenager would travel all over Brooklyn and Manhattan to sell his CDs. His own YouTube channel eventually made distributing his music and comedy easier, and he had some success selling beats to commercial producers.<br><br>Dheyshawn later worked as a manager at Radioshack, a job he loved. Vivi keeps his phone’s battery charged because former customers sometimes call, unaware that he has passed. “They’re trying to be friends with me now!” she said.<br><br>Dheyshawn had 2 children, Julian, now 18, and Dheyshawn, 14, who lives in London. On the morning he died, Dheyshawn found out that his sister was expecting her first child. He promised her “the biggest baby shower ever,' and was on the way to her house when he died.

                        Frances Faison says she can’t remember a single day in which her oldest son William gave her trouble, “He’d always come straight home from school,” she said. “He wouldn’t stop, I could count on him. He was good.”<br><br>His interest in helping people was obvious from an early age, and by his teenage years he was the go-to guy for landing jobs for his friends. Mrs. Faison said it was a natural progression when he decided to become a probation officer, working with troubled teens in Lower Manhattan. He soon married and had two children, Jalen, now 20, and Marcus, 12. <br><br>A few years ago, Faison’s life shifted course: his marriage broke down, which led him and Jalen to move in with Frances. He also left his job as a probation officer and began working as a counselor to disabled people in Queens.<br><br>Throughout the challenging times, Frances said William’s character never changed. He stayed close to both sons, worked hard in his church, and made sure everyone was taken care of. “If he was out, he would call 2 or 3 times to make sure I was okay,” Francis said. “He was always the same loving, caring person.”

The decision was not taken lightly; he loved his job, but his partner was suffering from cancer and needed full time care.<br><br>Elliot spent the next 10 years caring for his partner, who eventually succumbed to the disease. They had been together for 28 years. “It was a difficult time, but he was so caring and giving to others,” said Nick Zaccarelli, who worked in the building where Elliot lived.<br><br>A few years later, Elliot began a relationship with Nick, which sparked a renewed love of theatre and travel. They took cruises around Italy and explored Alaska and the Baltic Sea together, while fitting in 26 Broadway shows between January and June last year. “He was just enjoying retirement and enjoying life,” said Nick.<br><br>But their life together was not without challenge. Elliot had recently been fighting his own battle with cancer and had to have his bladder removed earlier this year. He was just getting his feet back on the ground, according to Nick, and learning to live life all over again.

Without a partner, he couldn’t compete.<br><br>“In 48 hours, he found a new young lady, had her rehearse, learn the steps, and helped her buy a gown,” said his father, Philbert Sr. “By the end they were so polished and of course, they won.”<br><br>Determination was something that marked everything he did, said his mother Lynette. At home, it meant keeping a close eye on his two younger brothers. “He would say, ‘If you ever get in trouble, don’t even bother to call mom and dad, you will have to deal with me,’” she said.<br><br>Williams split his time between volunteering at his church and studying criminal justice at John Jay College. He hoped to become a CIA agent.<br><br>Every Monday, he took a break from his studies to spend time with his mother. “He would come over and sit on my bed and talk about what was going on,” she said. “He gave me motivation as a mother because he was so good.”

By the time Anthony reached the 9th grade, he found himself sitting next to his brother Gilbert, who was 2 years older than him. “He skipped grades and caught up to me quickly,” Gilbert said. “Then he passed me!”<br><br>In his late teens, Anthony won a scholarship to study medicine at the University of Budapest, a course taught entirely in Hungarian. Gilbert said his brother didn’t speak the language before entering the program. “But he became fluent and qualified as a doctor,” Gilbert said.<br><br>Anthony returned to Kenya and earned a masters degree in public health before opening his own clinic. Many of his impoverished patients couldn’t afford to pay so he treated them for free. But then he couldn’t pay the rent and had to close down.<br><br>“After that he really wanted to see what else he could learn for his community,” Gilbert said. “So he moved to America to gain a PhD.” Anthony moved to New York in 1991; his wife and four children stayed behind on the family farm. In recent years, he’d been working hospital jobs while still trying to get the accreditation needed to practice medicine.

She had a young spirit.”<br><br>Originally from Morocco, Rosa moved to New York with her husband, Benjamin, and 3 children in 1967. She taught French at Lycée Français de New York and the Lincoln Square Academy, where many of her students were child actors.<br><br>Outside of work, her life was focused on her community in Forest Hills, Queens. Karine said Anindjar volunteered at her local temple and gave herself to others. Her greatest love became her grandchildren, and she eventually retired from teaching to help care for them.<br><br>The only time Karine remembers Rosa slowing down was when Benjamin died in 2004. They had been married for 49 years. “It really hit her,” Karine said. “But then she decided not to be unhappy anymore. Weddings, birthdays, bar mitzvah’s, you name it, she was there.”

Martin remembers fretting about his plan for the date, before deciding on the classic combo. “I went with dinner and a movie,” Martin said. “Thankfully it went well so she invited me back to her place.”<br><br>But then, three of her friends showed up. “And that’s how we ended the first date,” Martin said. “She fell asleep on the couch, and I was cramped in the well of a two-seat Porsche, being driven home by two guys I’d never met before.”<br><br>Their next few dates had better endings and, a few years later, they were married. “We balanced each other out,” Martin recalled, “I liked to be alone but she was always out there. I call myself the master of good intentions, but she had no separation between intention and action. She was a doer.”<br><br>Bonnie became a real estate agent in their hometown of Chevy Chase, Maryland. Her other passion was volunteering, most recently with the Tikkun Olam Women's Foundation, a group that is focused on social change for women.<br><br>At 65, she was looking forward to retirement so she could spend more time with her three children and three grandchildren. “And the volunteering would have become her career then,” Martin said. “She wouldn’t have slowed down. That’s not who she was.”

Naps were a waste of time, Kelly said, when there was always something better they could be doing.<br><br>She took her own advice, working part-time jobs and starting small businesses to pay her way through college. She also helped organize charity events for cancer research and, time permitting, baked elaborate cakes for her friends and family. <br><br>Her mother Lorraine said Kelly, the oldest of five children, was a natural leader. “Her love of life was contagious,” Lorraine said, “to the point where her ambition and compassion inspired everyone around her.”  <br><br>On the day Kelly died, she had just interviewed for a position at Goldman Sachs in Manhattan. She was set to graduate from college four weeks later.

To him, it was an overwhelming reminder of the loss of his only child, whom he called “Winky.”<br><br>But in the months that followed, family members boxed up her clothes and converted the room into a den for playing baseball on Nintendo, which they nicknamed, “Winky Memorial Stadium.”<br><br>Her father says the room is now a permanent reminder of the daughter he knew: a poker player, Yankee fan, beauty expert, designated “walker home” for friends who’d had too much to drink. “My best friend,” he concluded.<br><br>On the wall hangs her favourite denim jacket covered in love heart buttons. In a tank below lives her turtle, Daydolph Butch. She loved reptiles and wanted to work in nature conservation.<br><br>A few weeks before Gravely died, her father asked her opinion on his outfit: beige pants and a white hoodie. “She told me I looked like an ice cream cone,” he said. And that’s what he misses most -- someone who could always make him laugh, even when he didn’t want to.

                        Ida Rosenblatt was retired but so active in her neighborhood that her daughter Irma said, “It was like she worked nine to five.” <br><br>Ida would go down to City Hall with Riverdale Community leaders to protest cuts to a local community center.  She practiced yoga while recovering from breast cancer.<br><br> She was a regular at the Riverdale senior center, where she took tai chi classes and attended lectures. “She told me that she was working on a project called ‘reading for old people’,” Irma recalled with a laugh. “She was 87 years old but she didn’t think she was old – the others were!” <br><br>Ida wasn’t always so out-going. Her daughter said it took the death of Ida’s husband of 54 years, in 2001, to get her off the couch. “My father was more of a homebody but after he died she was never home,” Irma said. “She was in the prime of her life. I really thought she would live for another ten years.”

                        Roshard Charles was a picky eater. There were foods he loved, and foods he definitely didn’t. Waffles for breakfast were a favorite, as was chicken and rice. But pepperoni pizza was the best. <br><br>The workers at a 7-Eleven near his house would make sure they had it on hand for Roshard when he’d walk to school. His mother, Rochelle Charles, knew that if she walked Roshard past the store, he had to go in. The only way to have a non-pizza morning was to guide him on a route that avoided the store. “He loved pizza that much,” she said. <br><br>Rochelle said Roshard was one of the quiet ones in his kindergarten class at P.S. 375. But, she added with a laugh, “At home, he was a little different.” <br><br>Roshard was also impeccably neat. His mother said he sometimes clipped his nails by himself, and asked her to polish his school shoes every evening. He also loved the water, and showed off his swimming skills on trips to the Poconos, and on cruises to Jamaica and Haiti. <br><br>“He was very smart,” his mother said. “He wanted to be a doctor.”

                        William Pena was an early riser, usually leaving his home in Hillside, New Jersey, before 5 a.m. to start his shift as a bus driver with the MTA. His brother, Eriberto, knew his schedule well. That’s because William would send him texts as he headed to work. “He thought waking me up was funny,” Eriberto said.

                        William Pena was an early riser, usually leaving his home in Hillside, New Jersey, before 5 a.m. to start his shift as a bus driver with the MTA. His brother, Eriberto, knew his schedule well. That’s because William would send him texts as he headed to work. “He thought waking me up was funny,” Eriberto said.<br><br>On the same 14th street crosstown route he drove for almost two decades, William would often see another brother: Alex, who worked at a nearby hotel. Alex would put out his hand as if hailing the bus like a taxi; William would beep twice in return.<br><br>And William would sometimes see yet another brother as he drove: Lionel, a police officer at a precinct near Union Square. That was their neighborhood.<br><br>William planned to retire to the Dominican Republic -- where he was born and lived until the age of 2 -- with his partner, Nancy. They had recently brought their daughter Gabrielle there to celebrate her 16th birthday.<br><br>“In the last 5 a.m. text he joked that we should open a taco stand there,” said Eriberto. “Whatever we don’t sell, we eat.”

Growing up, Jelani was close to Imani and his other sister, Asha, despite their different personalities.<br><br>“He saved me as ‘Real Feel’ on his phone because I express my emotions a lot,” Imani laughed. “But he never got into his emotions. He was sensitive but he focused on solutions.”<br><br>Jelani graduated from high school with honors before enrolling at Medgar Evers College, where he was pursuing a creative writing degree. He worked various jobs to pay his way, from manager of his mom’s day-care center to a driver of double decker tourist buses. On the night he died, he was returning home from a shift as a yellow cab driver, a job he had started two weeks earlier.<br><br>“I always say I lived through him because he was always out there and had such great stories,” said Imani.  “I thought he was invincible.”

                        Pedro worked as a clerk at a book store. He loved to read but, after sending money to his family in Mexico each month, had little left over for books of his own. <br><br>Then Henry Rhinehart, owner of Henry’s Bistro on the Upper West Side, hired Pedro to work as the restaurant’s first deliveryman. Now Pedro had two jobs, but extra spending money, too. <br><br>“Pedro was the only employee I’ve ever had who would read Cervantes and great authors from around the world in his downtime,” Rhinehart said. “He wasn’t ambitious for money. He was ambitious for knowledge and experience and knew what he wanted, which was steady employment, to be treated with respect, and for it to be okay for him to read on his downtime.”<br><br> When Pedro died, he was was taking classes at Columbia University and was hoping to become an engineer. “It’s not everyone you’d find who’s as charming and educated and interesting as Pedro,” Rinehart said.

At first, she stayed in the building with co-workers, before a second tremble prompted her escape through a back staircase. A short while later the towers collapsed, destroying the hotel.<br><br>As for many New Yorkers that day, the attack felt personal. New York was the city that adopted her when she left her native Ecuador at age 21. It was where she made a living as a seamstress and a housekeeper. It was the place in which she survived cancer at 33.<br><br>Most importantly, it was the city where she raised her daughter, Zoraya Torres, and her grandson, Abel.  “She loved her church, loved her community, loved to go to bingo, loved her TV shows,” said Zoraya. “My mom was the anchor of our family. She kept us all together.”<br><br>In recent years Hurtado had been enjoying retirement and her family had taken to calling her ‘the travelling lady’ because of her trips to the Vatican, Spain, and home to Ecuador. Zoraya says that the thing she misses most is her mother’s hugs. “When she hugged you it was like all of your worries melted away. I don't think I’ll ever feel anything like that again.”

The teenage boys would feed and entertain Nydja, bring her to the movies and the park.<br><br>Initially, the trips were simply to get her out of the house. But they soon discovered other benefits. “Girls would just flock to us when they saw us with our cute sister,” Sango said. “It was great.”<br><br>Nydja also benefited from the attention paid to her and her brothers. “She loved to tease us in front of the girls and extort money from us,” laughed Sango.<br><br>The siblings were separated when Nydja moved to North Carolina at 15. While she enjoyed life in the South, she made her way back to Fordham Road in the Bronx when she was 26. “She reconnected with everyone she left behind,” Sango said. “It was always home for her.”<br><br>A few years later she met her partner, Kashif, and had twin boys, Kashmir and Nikhil. They are now 2 years old, and their uncle Sango tries to visit as often as possible. “I wish she could have enjoyed them like we enjoyed her,” said Sango.

                        Cooper Stock wanted to be a basketball player. But at nine years old, his NBA eligibility was a ways off. So he settled for watching his favorite team, the Knicks, play at Madison Square Garden. <br><br> “He’d get so excited,” his mom Dana Lerner said about Cooper at The Garden, watching games. “Not only would he high-five my husband, he would turn to high-five the next guy.”  <br><br>Cooper’s interests ranged beyond sports: he was curious about subjects such as the civil rights movement and Abraham Lincoln. “Whenever he learned something, he wanted to know everything about it,” Lerner said. “He was wise beyond his years.” <br><br>Cooper was a fan of classic rock, and his favorite song was “Little Wing” by Jimmy Hendrix. “Now I see him as a little wing,” Lerner said. “He’s flying on somewhere out there because he had such an incredible presence in the world.”

The collection he left behind is as large as it is quirky: a guitar made from a ham can, a toaster shaped like a piece of toast, and board games such as “Squeeze the Juice,” in which the object is to capture O.J. Simpson before he escapes to Mexico.<br><br>Sewald noted that as interesting as those items are, Alex didn’t love them only as objects. “He loved the people who dreamed-up their concepts and the people who made them,” Sewald said. “He always told me that what he really collected were people.”<br><br> Sewald said the when he moved to the city 22 years ago, he became one of the people that Mr. Shear collected. “Alex encouraged me in times of doubt and celebrated my victories,” Sewald recalled. “Alex would have answered his phone at 3 a.m. and driven hundreds of miles to help me if I truly needed him. He was singular.”

Recently, he’d also been supporting his sister, who was suffering from a prolonged illness.<br><br>“He never complained,” said Susan, who works in the front of the store, “He was always a cheerful, quiet guy.” Asuncion Mendez, Felipe’s girlfriend of 5 years, also worked at the bakery. In their off hours, they liked to spend time with her grandchildren, Alexander, 4, and Daisy, 2.<br><br>When he died, Avila’s body was returned home to his parents in Mexico.
